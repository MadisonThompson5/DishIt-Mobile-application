## Dish It!  

The user uploads a picture of their meal and the application will determine what foods are in the picture. Based on the food items in the picture, the application will determine how many calories the user has eaten for that particular meal and update the user's calorie count for the day.  

The application will also provide recommendations for the user based on their location, the user's current total calorie count, and the user's food preferences. The user is also able to create and edit a profile in which they can indicate their food preferences.
